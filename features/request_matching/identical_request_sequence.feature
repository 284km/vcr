Feature: Identical requests are replayed in sequence

  When a cassette contains multiple HTTP interactions that match a request
  based on the configured `:match_requests_on` setting, the responses are
  sequenced: the first matching request will get the first response,
  the second matching request will get the second response, etc.

  Scenario Outline: identical requests are replayed in sequence
    Given a previously recorded cassette file "cassettes/example.yml" with:
      """
